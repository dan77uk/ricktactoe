# The Odin Project - Tic Tac Toe App 

[Live Site](https://danphillipsuk.github.io/ricktactoe/)

An Odin Project module, as part of the full stack Javascript path, to further practice object creation and organising code in objects/modules in order to keep global namespace uncluttered.

My project pays homeage to Rick & Morty, and is currently limited to a two player game, whereby the competing characters objects are chosen at random from an array by the programme at the start of each round.

It could be improved by introducing an AI option and also improving the responsive styles.
